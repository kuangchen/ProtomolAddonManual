\begin{section} {Basic Usage}
Either through GUI interface or console, a user defines a simulation configuration file that instructs \textsc{ProtoMol} about simulation initial conditions, integrator, outputs, and other properties of simulation. The configuration file consists of entries in the format of ``keyword value'' pair. The most important part of the configuration file is the declaration of integrators and forces, which have their special syntax. 

An example input file is presented below, with the meaning of each keyword given in the comment line. To see a full list of keywords, please refer to Ref.
